I was really struggling with this guy while going for An Awfully Big Adventure, until I decided to bring in one of my favorite pets: Teroclaw Hatchling! He can almost solo this fight.

Team:
Teroclaw Hatchling 2,2,2
Any strong Mechanical
Elekk Plushie 1,1,2 (Recommend level 20 or above)

vs. Crusher
Open with Teroclaw Hatchling
Alpha Strike
Alpha Strike
Dodge (Whirlpool)
Alpha Strike until Crusher is dead

vs. Pounder
Switch to Elekk Plushie (it will soak Sandstorm/Rupture/Whirlpool if Crusher got another off)
Itchin' for a Stitchin'
-(-Note: if Elekk Plushie is stunned by Rupture, it's no big deal--still manually switch back to Teroclaw Hatchling)
Nature's Ward
Alpha Strike until Pounder is dead, using Dodge after his third Quake

vs. Mutilator
Alpha Strike
Nature's Ward
Dodge
Alpha Strike/Dodge on cd until Teroclaw Hatchling dies
Switch to Mechanical
Finish off Mutilator (Ion Cannon/Lock On x2/Shock and Awe/etc.)
