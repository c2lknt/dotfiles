vs Woodcarver
- Start with an Emerald Bite on round 1
- Then, repeat this exact sequence until Woodcarver dies: [start] Emerald Presence > Emerald Dream > 2x Emerald bite [repeat]. If you do it right, you will cast Emerald Presence each time Woodcarver has burrowed.

vs Lightstalker
- Emerald Presence > Emerald Bite until Lightstalker dies

vs Needleback
- Emerald Bite until your Emerald Proto-Whelp dies
- Switch to Carry pet > switch to Anubisath Idol
- From here on, cast Deflection when Needleback has Headbutt off cooldown, Sandstorm when off cooldown, Crush as a filler
