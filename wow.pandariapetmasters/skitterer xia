EDIT: I hear that in Legion this strategy will be greatly nerfed, but it still works fine in WoD 

You need:

1. Pandaren Water Spirit (any, whirlpool, geyser)
2. Chrominius (any, howl, surge of power)
3. Doesn't matter

Start with Pandaren Water Spirit:

1. Round 1: Geyser
2. Round 2: Whirlpool

Switch to Chrominius:

3. Round 3: Howl
4. Round 4: Surge of Power

This strategy works for nearly all pet fights where you only need to defeat one boss, with few exceptions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Use Iron Starlette Super Ultra Mega Punch instead of PWS
