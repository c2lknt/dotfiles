Anubisath Idol wrecks her team, leaving two slots for leveling. Set the Idol up 111,  Crush,  Sandstorm and  Deflection and start the fight using it. I use only one leveling pet with a Darkmoon Tonk in my third slot set up 112,  Missile,  Shock and Awe, and  Ion Cannon, for a faster fight and maximum level gain of one pet. Low level pets should have at least 280 health to soak two possible Sunlight casts from Siren while they're in the back row; Mechanicals will need even more health and Critters can get away with a little less (I'm not sure of exact numbers).

Summary:
vs Siren:
1. Sandstorm
2. Crush
3. Deflection
4. Crush
5. Crush
6. Crush
7. Deflection
8. Crush
9. Crush
... and restart from step 1 if Siren isn't dead yet.

vs Toothbreaker:
1. If Sandstorm isn't up, put it up. Otherwise skip to step 2.
2. Swap to low level pet
3. Swap back to Idol
4. On the turn where Sons emerges, use Deflection
5. Crush until Submerge
6. Sandstorm
7. Go back to step 4, passing until emerge.

vs Mothallus:
1. Crush
2. Pass
3. Deflection
4. Swap to Tonk
5. Shock and Awe
6. Ion Cannon if Mothallus is < 1000 hp (usual case), otherwise:
6a: Missile
6b: Ion Cannon
