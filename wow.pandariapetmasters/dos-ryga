5.3 Easy Mode strategy

So, the 5.3 change basically made his heal twice as powerful as before, so the key is to be able to burst him down in that 5 round window. Chrominius is the real key to this strategy, and then follow him up with a Crow/Gilnean Raven.
Open With Chrominius
Dos-Ryga uses Whirlpool
Chrominius uses Howl
Dos-Ryga uses Healing Wave for 0 health
Chrominius uses Bite (400+ damage)
Dos-Ryga uses Frost Breath
Chrominius uses Surge of Power (1000+ damage)
Chrominius eats another Frost Breath and dies to Whirlpool
Gilnean Raven Uses Call Darkness (200+ damage)
Dos-Ryga uses Frost Breath
Gilnean Raven uses Nocturnal Strike (300+ damage)
Dos-Ryga dies
The fight will follow this script every time as far as I can tell. He always uses Whirlpool and Healing Wave on Cooldown, in that order, and fills in with Frost Breath, so you get 5 rounds to kill him. Chrominius' 1400+ burst in 2 rounds trivializes this encounter.

Enjoy!
