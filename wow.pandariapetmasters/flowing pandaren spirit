Here's the routine I use. Personally, I have horrible RNG so if the Idol dies before the Elemental I tend to reset the fight.

Team Layout
Anubisath Idol: [Crush] [Sandstorm] [Deflection]
Rapana Whelk: [Ooze Touch] [Acidic Goo] [Dive]
Leveling Pet: Doesn't matter, just be sure it can survive ~700 Aquatic Damage

Battle Layout

Enter Marley
Round 1 - Sandstorm
Round 2 - Crush or Pass (Marley dives so you're going to miss)
Round 3 - Deflection
Round 4 - Crush *If this misses restart the battle before you take damage
Round 5 - Crush *If this misses restart the battle before you take damage
Round 6 - Crush
Round 7 - Call Sandstorm (You will be hit by Whirlpool but Marley should be dead)

Enter Tiptoe - If you Sandstorm to kill Marley
Round 1 - Crush
Round 2 - Crush
Round 3 - Crush
Round 4 - Crush
Round 5 - Crush
Round 6 - Tiptoe should be dead, if so continue below for Elemental if not use Sandstorm

Enter Tiptoe - Marley died before second Sandstorm
Round 1 - Deflection (To avoid Whirlpool leftover from Marley)
2 - Sandstorm
3 - Crush
4 - Crush
5 - Crush
6 - Crush
7 - Crush
Round 8 - If Tiptoe is still alive Sandstorm, if he's dead by now continue below

If You have bad RNG and Tiptoe kills your Idol, swap to Rapana Whelk and Ooze Touch until dead

Enter Water Spirit

If Idol is alive
Round 1 - Swap to Leveling pet
Round 2 - Attack
Round 3 - Switch to Idol
Round 4 - Deflection
Round 5 - Crush
Round 6 - Sandstorm (Or Crush if on cooldown)
Round 7 - Crush (or Sandstorm if off cooldown)
Round 8 - Crush (You will probably die from Whirlpool this round, if not continue Crush until you die)
Round ? - Swap to Rapana Whelk
Round ? - Dive
Round ? - Win
If for some reason Dive doesn't kill the elemental, Ooze Touch until it does.

If Idol is dead
Round 1 - Switch to Leveling pet
Round 2 - Attack
Round 3 - Switch to Rapana Whelk
Round 4 - Dive
Round 5 - Dive Hits
Until you win: Ooze Touch, if Dive comes off cooldown reuse.
