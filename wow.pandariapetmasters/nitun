i can only give one piece of advice for this fight: 

Undead pets.

their ability prevents them from getting killed by ravage, meaning that there is absolutely no healing taking place during the fight, which is exaclty the part that makes this fight so hard! The undead pet's racial takes the 'kill' at the end of the extra turn, so even if nitun deals the last blow with ravage, he won't get healed. This means you do NOT have to swap the undead pets out to avoid the heal. 

furthermore, while being a critter, Nitun has NO critter attacks, which means he cannot do extra damage to undead pets. Using a team of three undead pets (25,25,21 in my case, didn't even need the third) this fight becomes a cakewalk.

Like one of the helpfull comments below this post says, the third pet does not have to be undead, since if it dies, you've lost anyway so any healing is no longer an issue.
