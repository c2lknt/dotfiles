An Emperor Crab can solo all three of this tamer's pets. I have a P/P (Breed 4) level 25 rare that I regularly use for Aki. Set up the crab for Snap, Renewing Mists, and Shell Shield.

The trick is to make sure Renewing Mists and Shell Shield are always up. This can get tricky because of the duration of each spell is different so you can get in a pattern where you would have to cast both Renewing Mists and Shell Shield on the same turn. Just do the best you can - you might have to recast one a round early. Once you get Shell Shield up, Chirrup's attack will be fully blocked so you can let Renewing Mists fall off once you are fully healed. For the other two pets, Renewing Mists + Shell Shield should be enough to let the crab kill them - barring really bad RNG.
