s with any here are/will be positiv.  My entire set of concerns have been raised up a level - so many small concerns just don't seem worth it anymore.  And the experience of having to accept all of this feels transformative: I have a much deeper compassion for people I encounter, deeper appreciation for our comfort and security, and respect for its fragility.  I do feel a bit too exhausted to actually appreciate any of it, but someday I'll feel rested again.

Reminds me of that song Every Mother's Son - which I like, not because it expresses that there are good and bad times, but rather that it emphasizes that *everyone* will rise and fall some day - a downturn isn't bad luck, it's just how life goes.  My downturn may look different from yours, but it's just the details that are different.  My current nadir may end, and I may get a chance to enjoy that feeling of comfort and complacency again; or it may not.  Neither will be just or fair, whichever is will be, and I'll be, and that'll be that.  

I guess that's the core of what I'd like to communicate to the world today: stay humble, and grateful.
